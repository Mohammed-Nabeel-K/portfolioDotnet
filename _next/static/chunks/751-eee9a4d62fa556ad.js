Looking back at my first year, every struggle taught me something valuable.\n\n## Getting Started with .NET\nI began by learning the fundamentals of C#, like classes, methods, OOP principles, and exception handling. Once I was comfortable with those, I started creating small console-based applications to apply what I had learned.\n\nThen, I moved on to ASP.NET Core, where I explored how to create APIs, connect with databases, and work on real backend logic.\n\n## What Helped Me Learn Effectively\nI built mini projects to apply concepts practically.\n\nI relied on official documentation and tutorial articles to understand new topics.\n\nWatching video tutorials helped me visualize the code and workflows.\n\nI spent a lot of time debugging, which strengthened my understanding of the framework.\n\n## Key Concepts That Made a Difference\nUnderstanding the middleware pipeline gave me control over how requests and responses were handled.\n\nLearning about dependency injection made my code cleaner and easier to test.\n\nUsing async/await improved performance and scalability.\n\nImplementing API versioning early helped me think ahead about future updates.\n\n## Tools That Supported Me\nVisual Studio – my main development environment.\n\nPostman – essential for testing APIs.\n\nGit – for version control.\n\nSwagger – for documenting and interacting with my Web APIs.\n\n## Lessons from Mistakes\nIgnoring clean code practices early made future changes difficult.\n\nI underestimated the importance of input validation at first.\n\nOverlooking simple error messages cost me time — now I pay attention to every detail.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n.NET can feel huge at first, but with practice and the right mindset, it becomes manageable and enjoyable. Start small, stay consistent, and focus on building real things. You’ll be surprised how far you can go in just a year.\n",tags:[".NET","C#","Career","Learning","Beginner Tips"],imageUrl:"https://placehold.co/800x400.png?text=Learning+.NET",dataAiHint:"learning code"},{slug:"things-i-wish-i-knew-dotnet",title:"Things I Wish I Knew When I Started .NET Development",date:"2024-07-30",excerpt:"When I first started working with .NET, I was focused on building APIs quickly — but I didn't fully understand many of the powerful features built into the framework.

Over time, I realized how some early lessons could have made my journey smoother and more efficient.\n\n## Minimal Hosting Looks Simple — But Deserves Attention\nWith the minimal hosting model introduced in .NET 6, a lot happens behind the scenes in just a few lines of code. I initially just copied boilerplate setups, but later realized how critical it was to understand how services, middleware, and routing are configured in Program.cs.\n\n## Dependency Injection Is Not Just for Large Applications\nI used to create objects manually, not realizing how central dependency injection is in .NET applications. Once I got familiar with registering and injecting services properly, it made the code more modular, testable, and scalable.\n\n## Middleware Gives You Control\nAt first, I ignored middleware, thinking it was only needed in complex apps. But later, I started using it for exception handling, logging, and authentication — and it gave me much more control over how requests and responses flow through the application.\n\n## Add API Versioning Early\nWhen I made changes to existing endpoints, I quickly understood the pain of not using API versioning. Planning for versions early helps you manage growth and support changes without breaking existing consumers.\n\n## Use Async/Await Wherever Possible\nBlocking operations might seem fine at first, but they impact performance as the app grows. Learning to use async/await for I/O-bound operations helped me build more responsive APIs and follow modern best practices.\n\n## Enable Swagger from Day One\nOnce I added Swagger to my projects, everything became easier — from testing endpoints to sharing documentation with others. It’s an essential tool for working with APIs and speeds up collaboration across teams.\n\n## Centralized Logging and Error Handling\nEarly in my journey, I had scattered try-catch blocks and inconsistent error messages. I later learned to use built-in logging features and custom exception handling middleware to manage this in one place. It made the app cleaner and easier to troubleshoot.\n\n## Final Thought\n.NET development has a learning curve, but once you understand the architecture and best practices, it becomes incredibly powerful.

Each project challenged me differently and helped me grow as a developer. Here's what stood out the most from my practical experience with .NET.\n\n## Planning the Structure Before Writing Code\nIn my early projects, I jumped into coding without a clear structure. Over time, I realized the importance of planning — setting up layers like controllers, services, repositories, and models properly made everything more maintainable and scalable.\n\n## Clean Architecture Makes a Difference\nInitially, I built everything in a single layer, but as complexity increased, the code became hard to manage. Learning and applying concepts like Clean Architecture or layered architecture helped me separate concerns, making the codebase easier to test, extend, and debug.\n\n## Writing APIs That Make Sense to Others\nI used to name endpoints based on what made sense to me. But when I started working in teams or integrating with other apps, I realized the importance of clear API design, consistent naming, proper use of HTTP verbs, and returning useful responses.\n\n## Validating Inputs Is Not Optional\nI learned (the hard way) that assuming users will send correct data is risky. Adding model validation and proper error messages became a standard part of my development process. It’s one of the simplest ways to improve application quality.\n\n## Testing — Even Basic — Goes a Long Way\nAt first, I skipped testing to “save time,” but that time often came back as debugging headaches. Eventually, I started writing unit tests for core logic and integration tests for APIs. It gave me confidence in my code and reduced surprises in production.\n\n## Real Projects Expose Real Problems\nWhen building apps like dashboards, management systems, or public APIs, I ran into actual issues like rate limits, authentication flaws, inconsistent data, or deployment troubles. These taught me practical lessons you rarely get from tutorials.\n\n## Logging Is Invaluable in Real Environments\nIn local development, everything seems smooth. But once I deployed real projects, I learned the importance of structured logging and meaningful logs. They helped trace issues, monitor performance, and communicate better during support or debugging.\n\n## Final Thought\nEvery real-world project has its own challenges, but each one is a chance to grow. Working on actual problems — not just textbook exercises — helped me learn more about writing maintainable, scalable, and secure .NET applications.\n",tags:[".NET","C#","Software Development","Best Practices","Project Experience"],imageUrl:"https://placehold.co/800x400.png?text=Real+Projects",dataAiHint:"project development"}];a.A,r.A,r.A,i.A,i.A},3745:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{E:()=>s});var a=t(95155);t(12115);var r=t(74466),i=t(59434);let o=(0,r.F)("inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-semibold transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:ring-offset-2",{variants:{variant:{default:"border-transparent bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/80",secondary:"border-transparent bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",destructive:"border-transparent bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/80",outline:"text-foreground"}},defaultVariants:{variant:"default"}});function s(e){let{className:n,variant:t,...r}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:(0,i.cn)(o({variant:t}),n),...r})}},30285:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{$:()=>d});var a=t(95155),r=t(12115),i=t(99708),o=t(74466),s=t(59434);let c=(0,o.F)("inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:size-4 [&_svg]:shrink-0",{variants:{variant:{default:"bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",destructive:"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",outline:"border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",secondary:"bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",ghost:"hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",link:"text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline"},size:{default:"h-10 px-4 py-2",sm:"h-9 rounded-md px-3",lg:"h-11 rounded-md px-8",icon:"h-10 w-10"}},defaultVariants:{variant:"default",size:"default"}}),d=r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,variant:r,size:o,asChild:d=!1,...l}=e,m=d?i.DX:"button";return(0,a.jsx)(m,{className:(0,s.cn)(c({variant:r,size:o,className:t})),ref:n,...l})});d.displayName="Button"},59434:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{cn:()=>i});var a=t(52596),r=t(39688);function i(){for(var e=arguments.length,n=Array(e),t=0;t<e;t++)n[t]=arguments[t];return(0,r.QP)((0,a.$)(n))}},62523:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{p:()=>o});var a=t(95155),r=t(12115),i=t(59434);let o=r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,type:r,...o}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("input",{type:r,className:(0,i.cn)("flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-background px-3 py-2 text-base ring-offset-background file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium file:text-foreground placeholder:text-muted-foreground focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50 md:text-sm",t),ref:n,...o})});o.displayName="Input"},63803:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{z:()=>r});var a=t(95155);function r(e){let{title:n,description:t,children:r}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"mb-8 border-b pb-4",children:(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-center md:justify-between",children:[(0,a.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,a.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-foreground sm:text-4xl",children:n}),t&&(0,a.jsx)("p",{className:"mt-2 text-lg text-muted-foreground",children:t})]}),r&&(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"mt-4 md:mt-0 md:ml-4",children:r})]})})}},66695:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{Wu:()=>d,ZB:()=>c,Zp:()=>o,aR:()=>s,wL:()=>l});var a=t(95155),r=t(12115),i=t(59434);let o=r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,...r}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("div",{ref:n,className:(0,i.cn)("rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm",t),...r})});o.displayName="Card";let s=r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,...r}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("div",{ref:n,className:(0,i.cn)("flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6",t),...r})});s.displayName="CardHeader";let c=r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,...r}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("div",{ref:n,className:(0,i.cn)("text-2xl font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight",t),...r})});c.displayName="CardTitle",r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,...r}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("div",{ref:n,className:(0,i.cn)("text-sm text-muted-foreground",t),...r})}).displayName="CardDescription";let d=r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,...r}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("div",{ref:n,className:(0,i.cn)("p-6 pt-0",t),...r})});d.displayName="CardContent";let l=r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,...r}=e;return(0,a.jsx)("div",{ref:n,className:(0,i.cn)("flex items-center p-6 pt-0",t),...r})});l.displayName="CardFooter"}}]);
